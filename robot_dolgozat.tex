The thesis’ goal is to accomplish a network communication between a mobile application and a MINDSTORMS EV3 two wheeled self balancing robot. To achieve this goal there are two main factors that need to be taken into consideration. Firstly the mobile application that needs to make the communication with the robot, and secondly an algorithm which makes the balancing of the robot possible.

The application and the algorithm which handles the balancing were written in Java. The EV3 control unit is responsible for navigating the robot with the help of the leJOS Linux based framework. The robot remains in a balanced position by using its PID controller and its gyroscope sensor. For it to remain in a balanced state, its velocity, tilt angle and angular velocity needs to approximate to zero. Also its position needs to approximate to zero if it were to remain in a standing balanced position.The PID’s input argument is the error variable which is the difference between the expected value and the current value. In our case we need the error to approximate to zero in order to not lose its balance. Because of this the expected value is always zero. In conclusion the error is made up of four components: the robots tilt angle, angular velocity, velocity and position. By properly modifying these components we can manipulate the robot’s movement.The mobile application connects to the robot through the network and sends eligible commands to it. To accomplish and automated connection between the two components I’ve used the UPnP library, which uses SSDP protocol.

This work is the result of my own activity. I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this work.
